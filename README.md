- **10x Performance**: Bulk scanning vs single-card competitors
- **Professional Quality**: Enterprise-grade architecture
- **Offline-First**: Works without internet connection  
- **Accurate Recognition**: ML Kit + Scryfall API integration
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with comprehensive features

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0+)
- JDK 1.8+

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madams239/mtg-managerial.git
   cd mtg-managerial
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned directory

3. **Sync dependencies**
   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle dependencies
   - Wait for the build to complete

4. **Run the app**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button or press Shift+F10

### API Configuration

The app uses the Scryfall API for card identification (no API key required):
- Base URL: `https://api.scryfall.com`
- Rate limit: 50-100ms between requests
- All requests are handled automatically with retry logic

## 📱 Core Workflows

### Bulk Binder Scanning
1. **Open Scanner**: Navigate to the Scanner tab
2. **Position Binder**: Place binder page within the grid overlay
3. **Choose Layout**: Select 3x3 (9 cards) or 4x3 (12 cards) grid
4. **Scan Cards**: Tap "Scan Cards" button
5. **Review Results**: View identified cards with prices and details
6. **Save Collection**: Add cards to your collection database

### Collection Management  
1. **View Collection**: Browse all scanned cards
2. **Search & Filter**: Find specific cards by name, set, or rarity
3. **Sort Options**: Organize by name, set, rarity, price, or date added
4. **Collection Stats**: View total value and rarity distribution
5. **Manage Cards**: Delete cards or update quantities

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Run Instrumented Tests
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Test Coverage
- **CardProcessingPipeline**: Comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Mock Framework**: Mockito-Kotlin for isolated testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, partial results, edge cases

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK  
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Install debug APK
./gradlew installDebug
```

## 📈 Performance Targets

- **Scan Speed**: 9-12 cards in 10-15 seconds
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ card identification rate
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB during bulk scanning
- **Collection Size**: Supports 10,000+ cards efficiently
